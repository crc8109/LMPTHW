An exercise in creativity:

Random sentences - Community recreates offices, Rick.

Essay:

Rick tastes mega seeds. He sees Morty be incompetent at being a cosmic nihilist. He hears Summer's insecurities and not being the favorite. He feels warm when drinking. But never smells who dealt it.

Communities tend to recreate offices. See Dan Harmon.

And now, a poem:

Light from the green door
Moves west, Rick and Morty's shadows
Creep eastward

(Ripped off from Yosa Buson)
