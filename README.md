# Learn MORE Python The Hard Way: Solutions

This is my solutions to [Zed Shaw's book LMPTHW](https://learncodethehardway.org/more-python/). If you need to learn a new language, I recommend his books.

## What This Includes
All solutions from his book as of 8/4/21.

# Getting Started

## Requirements
* Python3
* a CLI (if you're on Windows, this is the Command Prompt; for Linux and Mac, this is your terminal)
* [Zed Shaw's book LMPTHW](https://learncodethehardway.org/more-python/)

## Quick Start
You can go run these solutions in the terminal to compare them to your answers. Or, you can look at the code to read my notes that further explain what Zed covers.

## Starting from Scratch
Follow the guide in Zed's book. If your solutions don't match mine, check out the code. I've added notes explaining the solutions and the material covered in the book.
